# Spam-Mail-Detection-Using-Naive-Byes
The purpose of this project is to segregate into the spam mail and ham.
Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes Theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. 
Tools & technologies used: matplotlib, wordcloud, pandas , Jupyter Notebook, Github
